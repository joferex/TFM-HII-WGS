    # These are the default settings, with values representing the maximum minor allele frequency in percent (%) permitted for an
    # allele to be considered as a causative candidate under that mode of inheritance.
    # If you just want to analyse a sample under a single inheritance mode, delete/comment-out the others. For AUTOSOMAL_RECESSIVE
    # or X_RECESSIVE ensure *both* relevant HOM_ALT and COMP_HET modes are present.
